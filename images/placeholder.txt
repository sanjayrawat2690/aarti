For the Ghibli-style images of Hindu deities, you would need to:

1. Commission an artist who can create Ghibli-inspired artwork of the 50 deities
2. Generate images using AI image generation tools like Midjourney or DALL-E with prompts like "studio ghibli style art of [deity name], soft colors, peaceful, detailed, spiritual"
3. Use placeholder images initially while the artwork is being created

Image specifications:
- Square images with 1:1 aspect ratio (recommended size: 500x500px)
- Soft Ghibli-like colors with pastel tones
- Peaceful and reverent artistic style
- Focus on the deity's face and distinctive features
- Simple backgrounds with soft gradients

Remember to name each image according to the deity id in the data.js file (e.g., "ganesh.jpg", "lakshmi.jpg").
