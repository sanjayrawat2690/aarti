To implement the image changes:

1. Save the first image in the conversation (Lord Ganesh with marigold garlands) as "ganesh.jpg" in the images folder.

2. Save the second image in the conversation (Lord Shiva meditating with blue skin) as "shiva.jpg" in the images folder.

3. Save the third image in the conversation (Goddess Lakshmi on lotus) as "lakshmi.jpg" in the images folder.

After saving these images, the website will display these beautiful Ghibli-style deity images instead of the default SVG placeholders.

Note: Make sure the image dimensions are appropriate (recommended: 500x500px or similar square aspect ratio) and that the file sizes are optimized for web.
